# qb-customs-esx
Vehicle Customization For qb-Core converted to ESX

Make sure to read the locations.lua settings VERY carefully. It has all the information needed to properly setup all your locations. Chances are if something is not working, your configuration for that location is wrong. 


This has been converted from qb-core as a little project for myself.

everything works to drag and drop into resources folder and ensure/start 'qb-customs-esx'
